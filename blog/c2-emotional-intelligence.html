  <h2><center>What learnings did you take from chapter one?</center></h2>
    <p class="a1">
        The first thing I took from chapter one was that my understanding of self awareness, self regulation and attention was way off, after watching Shereefs video,<br>
        and then reading the first chapter of Search Inside Yourself I also realised there was a lot I didn't know, this has only confirmed that.<br>
        I belive that everyone is capable of developing their own emotional intelligence, and it it something that should never really stop being nurtured.<br>
    </p>
  
  <h2><center>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</center></h2>
    <p class="a2">
        Difficult, my mind tends to drift, I put the timer on and tried to focus on my breathing, but found my focus drifting probably four or<br>
        five times throughout the two minutes. This is something I will be working on, as after the two minutes was up I did feel 'different' more focused.<br>
        I am aiming to try two minutes every time I come back from a long break before starting again. I feel that two minutes of mindfulness already helps<br>
        to focus my attention on the tasks at hand.
