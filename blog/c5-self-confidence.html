  <h1><center>Search Inside Yourself C4</center></h1>
  
  <h2><center> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</center></h2>
    <p class="a1">
        The answer for this question is broken down into two quotes which I will pull straight from Search Inside Yourself.
        Firstly: Self Awareness is a neutral mode that maintains self reflectiveness even in the midst of turbelent emotions. -Daniel Goleman.
        Secondly: Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally. -Jon Kabat-Zinn
        They seem to essentially be the same thing, the main difference is that mindfulness is initially something that is learnt and Self Awareness happens naturally.
        However you can train both, so they end being very similar.    
        </p>
  
  <h2><center>Try at least one of the self awareness practices (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</center></h2>
    <p class="a2">
        I attempted the body scan, nearly fell asleep. It is 10pm however, but over the last few weeks I have become far more receptive to mindfulness 
        and I can feel the benefits.
    </p>
  <h2><center>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</center></h2>
    <p class="a2">
        Acheiving the power to seperate and recognise your emotive state gives you great power over them which will enable greater self control and 
        ability to master the emotion.
    </p>
