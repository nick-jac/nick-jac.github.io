  <h1><center>C4 Daily Mindfulness</center></h1>
  
  <h2><center> What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'?</center></h2>
    <p class="a1">I found it quite hard to speak for four minutes, my partner thought I was rambling on a bit and then tuned out. This made feedback quite difficult</p>
      
  <h2><center>How did the other person find it?</center></h2>
    <p class="a2">I focused on my partners speaking and found I was wandering off and missed a fair bit, my recal of she was saying was quite patchy.</p>

  <h2><center>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</center></h2>
    <p class="a3">As I am working on my own a fair bit during the day, I'm going to use options 2&3. Staying within my abilities makes a lot of sense.</p>
    <p>Taking one mindful breath several times a day is within my abilities, I am trying to achieve this after every break I take. </p>
  
    <h2><center>Any other musings?</center></h2>
    <P class="a4">I'm interested in bringing Joyfull Mindfulness into my practice, I would lke to think I could achieve sukha at some time in my life.</P>
