      <h4>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h4>
      <p>Before starting this course I owned a business, which I had for about eight years. During the first year we experienced the chch earthquakes which impacted upon all my staff (8) As a boss I had to make decisions about how to handle all of my staff and it was a learning exp. I initially thought that I could apply 
      my reaction to everything and expect the same out comes. This way was not good and a year after the earthquakes I had turned over all my staff. 
      With the new staff I found that the more honest I was with them and the more empathetic and compassionate I was, the result was a more motivtaed team who all went the extra mile.
      My staff that started with me after the earthquke all went 5 years or more and only left through decisions outside of work. Some lasted until I sold the business, which was what I believe to be a great
      testament to my ability to relate to my staff and see them for more than just a resource to be manipulated.
