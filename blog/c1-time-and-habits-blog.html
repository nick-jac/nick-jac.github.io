    <h2><em><center>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</center></em></h2>
      <p> I've started with the Pomodoro Technique, which has been fine this morning until I was called away, I need to work on it more until
          I have found a way of applying the right time period and sticking to it. I am also interested in Creating Habits and in particular 
          the practice of focusing on small increments, these two options together I think will be a great combination.  
     </p>  
    
    <h2><em><center>What did you find interesting?</center></em></h2>
      <p> The meditation, I had a go at it but my focus did not last very long, a matter of a couple of minutes, this is something 
          I would like to folow up on and allocate some more time to.
      </p> 

    <h2><em><center>What worked for you?</center></em></h2>
      <p> So far, the Pomodoro Technique seems to fit, but I think going forward it will be a combination of the different techniques that
          will work best for me.
      </p> 
   
    <h2><em><center>Which will you experiment further with?</center></em></h2>
      <p> All of them until I create the perfect mix. 
      </p>
