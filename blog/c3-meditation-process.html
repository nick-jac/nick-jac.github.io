  <h2><center>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</center></h2>
    <p class="a1">
        As I am developing these pages, I have made a mental note that the process will lead to the end product. Combining the meditative
        processes along with the developmental processes seems to be the way forward, although I am also using the Pomodoro tecnique, especially 
        when I want to follow a process down a path that takes me away from my immediate goals.

  <h2><center>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</center></h2>
    <p class="a2">
        Before starting to read about meditation, I hadn't given it a great deal of thought, 
        I did picture having to go to a place to learn meditation techniques and having a 'special' quiet place 
        somewhere to practice it. I must say I'm pleasently surprised by what I read.
    </p>
  <h2><center>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</center></h2>
    <p class="a2">
        The idea that there is no such thing as bad meditation, it all based on attention and meta attention, being able to bring your 
        focus back.
    </p>
    <h2><center>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</center></h2>
    <p class="a2">
        I like the idea of the Grandmother mind, being able to adopt the mindset of a loving grandmother.
    </p>
    <h2><center>Any other musings?</center></h2>
    <p class="a2">
        Posture and being relaxed and alert at the same time.
    </p>
