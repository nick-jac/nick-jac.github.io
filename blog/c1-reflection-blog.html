  <h1><center>My journey starts here with My Reflections</center></h1>
  
  <h2><center>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</center></h2>
    <p class="a1">High intensity, being dropped in the deep end, pressure and stress, these seem to be the take outs to me, I think from
    my perspective I am fizzing on all of these. Shereef also emphasized the importance of "soft skills" this was not something
    I had anticipated before starting this course. However from what I have dealt with so far I am coming around to see
    it's place in this industry and it is something that I can see being extremely useful!
    </p>
  
  <h2><center>What are your impressions?</center></h2>
    <p class="a2">My initial impressions were OMG what have I got myself into??? My personal experience over the last eight years or so has
    been from a very non IT background, however I am enjoying the process here immensely and am trying to intergrate myself
    into the system and processes as fast as possible.
    </p>
  <h2><center>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</center></h2>
    <p class="a3">I think I am suited to it more than I may heve realised, I am focusing on expanding my creative side which I hadnt expected
    to do.
    </p>
  <h2><center>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</center></h2>
    <P class="a4">Yes, listening to Shereefs words gave me a whole new impression of what I am doing here, it was quite a bit of a mind reset.
    I went from the restaurant to the kitchen, as I feel without a high level of collabaration the takeout from this opportunity
    would minimized.
    </P>
  <h2><center>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</center></h2>
    <p class="a5">Yes nervous and excited, both at the same time! I am also very happy to see the use of Te Reo coming through and the attention
    paid to the divergent student populace. Combined with the technical and soft skills paths EDA is taking me on and the
    diverse range of people here, I feel that my time with EDA is going to be positive both in learning and personal growth.
    Just goes to show that your never too old to learn :) And yes stress, but in a positive, great way.
    </p>
