          <h4>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h4>
          <p>I followed the Just Like Me and Loving Kindness Mediataion exercises on my own. I feel they progressed well, I look forward to applying these along side my other soft skills.</p>
            <div class="text-questions answers">
              <h4>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h4>
              <p>Didn't have a chance to but reading it makes a lot of sesnse, esp the doughnuts!!</p>

                  <h4>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h4>
                  <p>Very insightful, made me look at things from anothers perspective.</p>

                    <h4> Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h4>
                    <p>A situation arose within a company I used to work for where I was producing some work for a set of clients and a contractor was also producing some similar work and part of both of our respective recipients lapped over.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>From my point of view I was creating some work that targeted a specific group.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The contractor was creating a one size fits all product that he wanted to incude this group in.</p> 
                    <br>
                    <p>From my point of view I was trying to target the professional dev of this group to enable more sales through their channel</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The contractor was trying to include this group to push a generic piece of work to make his own sales figures better</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I won! better product! better outcome!</p>

                        <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
                        <p>Not at this time, except, I will be very interested to see how much openness plays out in the working world.</p>
