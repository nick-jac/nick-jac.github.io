        <h2>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?
        </h2>
            <p>Responsive web design (RWD) is an approach to web design which makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. Content, design and performance are necessary across all devices to ensure usability and satisfaction.

        <h2>What is semantic structure?
        </h2>
        <h3>“Semantic HTML” refers to the idea that all your HTML markup should convey the underlying meaning of your content—not its appearance.</h3>
        <p>Creating a web page with semantic structure has long been considered a best practice because it gives the web page more meaning.
