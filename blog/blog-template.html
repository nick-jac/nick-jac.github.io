          <h4>What is a responsive site?</h4>
          <p>A responsive web site is one that has been designed to be accessed by any sized device without any issues.</p>
          <div class="text-questions answers">
            <h5>Why is responsiveness important?</h5>
            <p>A responsive web site creates a more streamlined web presence and makes it easier to manage by only having to
              maintain one site.</p>

            <div class="text-questions answers">
              <h4>What is mobile first design?</h4>
              <p>Mobile first design is an idea that responsive site should be designed from the mobile screen outwards as the
                mobile design should be the hardest to get right.</p>
              <div class="text-questions answers">
                <h5>Why is mobile first important?</h5>
                <p>Mobile first from a product design focus helps to save time and forces designers to pay more attention to
                  content.
                </p>

                <div class="text-questions answers">
                  <h4>What are frameworks?</h4>
                  <p>Frameworks are tools (code toolsets) that import code into your website to help with the building of it.
                  </p>
                  <div class="text-questions">
                    <h5>What are pros and cons?</h5>
                    <p>Pros: Efficiency Tasks that usually would take you hours and hundreds of lines of code to write, can
                      now be done in minutes with pre-built functions. Development becomes a lot easier. Security, a widely
                      used framework has big security implementations. A big advantage is the community behind it, where
                      users become long-term testers. Cost, most popular frameworks are free, and since it also helps the
                      developer to code faster, the cost for the final client will be smaller. Support, as any other distributed
                      tool, a framework usually comes with documentation, a support team, and big community forums where
                      you can obtain quick answers. </p>

                    <p>Cons: You learn the framework, not the language. Limitation, the framework’s core behaviour can’t be
                      modified. Code is public Since the framework is available to everyone which can lead to issues with
                      security.

                      <h4>What is a wireframe?</h4>
                      <p>A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents
                        the skeletal framework of a website. .</p>
                      <div class="text-questions answers">
                        <h5>Why do we use them?</h5>
                        <p>Wireframes are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose</p>

                        <div class="text-questions answers">
                          <h4>What aspects of my wireframe process did I find difficult?</h4>
                          <p> A lack of information for my website, in the future I will be looking forward to putting them together
                            with a lot more detail, plus using Adobe to create them as my hand drawing skills are non existant.</p>
