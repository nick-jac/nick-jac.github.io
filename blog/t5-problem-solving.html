        <h2>
            <center> The time I got blocked on a simple problem.</center>
        </h2>
        <p class="a1">
            <strong>What was the problem?</strong> Getting error messages on lines of code.
            <br>
            <strong>What problem solving techniques did I use?</strong> Mainly Google, also using other code as a reference.
            <br>
            <strong>How did I feel throughout the process?</strong> Frustrated.
            <br>
            <strong>What did I learn?</strong> To take more time when checking code the first time.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <center>The time I solved a problem in an elegant way.</center>
        </h2>
        <p class="a2">
            <strong>What was the problem?</strong> I wanted to apply different backgrounds to my web-site.
            <br>
            <strong>What problem solving techniques did I use?</strong> Google initially then MDN, what I found was that I got the
            best results from trying to apply code I have already written then modify it to fit the requirements I needed.
            <br>
            <strong>How did I feel throughout the process?</strong> More frustration as any issues were usually syntax based, I am
            also trying to create my library of terms and examples set in a way I can refer back to and apply as required,
            this could be a large job as I have only a very small understanding of what I need.
            <br>
            <strong>What did I learn?</strong> Patience and perservarance will get me there in the end. But I also need to ask more
            our cohort to speed up my ability to get code written.

        </p>
        <h2>
            <center>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</center>
        </h2>
        <p class="a2">
            <strong>Pseudocode:</strong> This is something I haven't played with much, but looks like it could be good, if not a
            little time consuming.
            <br>
            <strong>Trying something:</strong> Use this option a lot, hope to incorporate it with the Google de-bugger.
            <br>
            <strong>Rubber Ducky Method:</strong> First thing I am going to do is go out and purchase a bright yellow rubber ducky,
            one thats squeaks when I squeeze it instead of throwing my computer across the room.
            <br>
            <strong>Reading Error Messages:</strong> I will use this and do for HTML and CSS, but am still trying to get my head
            around it in Java. Console.logging: I havent really used it properly yet.
            <strong>Googling:</strong> Love Google, I am however trying to create my own reference library that narrows down the
            range of answers I otherwise would get fed.
            <br>
            <strong>Asking Your Peers For Help or Asking Coaches For Help:</strong> I know you are there to help, but I don't want
            to waste your time, espically when I feel that I should be able to solve any issues I have on my own.
            <br>
            <strong>Improving Your Process With Reflection:</strong> Very important, the better I get at this particular technique
            the more confident I will be in fixing my errors.
        </p>

        <h2>
            <center>Describe what these functions do in your own words:</center>
        </h2>
        <p class="a2">
            <strong>.map()</strong> This function uses a set argument to convert one array to a new array, one array has a string
            of numbers, .map creates a calculaton on each element and creates a new array for the ouyput.
            <br>
            <strong>.filter()</strong> This function uses an arguement as a set of criteria for elements in array to pass, then creates
            a new array with the output from the first array.
            <br>
            <strong>.reduce()</strong> This function accumulates all the elements in a function to reduce them to a single value.
            If there is a string of numbers, the accumulator will act on the return values and output a single value, or
            reduce the name values to their totaled number.
