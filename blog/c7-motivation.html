                <div class="text-questions">
                    <h4> How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
                    <p>I believe that achieving Higher Purpose then Passion then Pleasure is a very hard thing to do as Pleasure
                        is fleeting and there are more stimulai for it, which makes it easier to obtain than the pursuit
                        of Higher Purpose which takes a lot more effort and focus. So I think the hard work to obtain Higher
                        Purpose will be worth it in the long run, but not being distracted by short term pleasure hunting
                        along the way is important.</p>
                    <div class="text-questions answers">
                        <h4> What are your core values</h4>
                        <p>My core values are attiude, always looking for the postive, forward thinking, not dwelling on the
                            past, patience, staying calm and not letting my emotions run away with me.</p>
                        <div class="text-questions answers">
                            <h4>What do you stand for?</h4>
                            <p>As I get older and more experienced what I stand for changes, the things that I find important
                                are community, encouragement, striving and not wasting time, its the only thing we can't get
                                more of.</p>
                            <div class="text-questions answers">
                                <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
                                <p>Interesting, I felt that the physical responses were very similar, the bodies reaction was
                                    to tense. I dont know about this one, although I hope that working this in with the other
                                    styles will give me more options in how to deal with success and failure.</p>

                                <h4> Any other musings?</h4>
                                <p>Time is running short for much of a more in depth look right away, although I like the idea
                                    of learning optimism and unlearning pessimism.</p>
