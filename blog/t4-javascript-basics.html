        <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
        <div class="text-questions">
          <h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
          <p>The best way for me to compare the three languages is to think of HTML as the framework or basic structure much like a housing frame.</p>
          <p>CSS is the decor, layout of rooms, colours etc. JavaScript is like the wiring that makes everything work, JavaSript controls the behaviour of the code (elements).</p>
          
        <div class="text-questions">
          <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h4>
          <p>Control Flows allow the coder to run certain scenaros or until certain conditions are met using different staements, eg; IF today is Saturday then alarm goes off at 9.00am ELSE alarm goes off at 7.00am.</p>
          <p>Loops let you run code a certain number of times until a condition is met, eg; When cleaning teeth, Brush up and down, are teeth clean yes/no IF yes then stop, ELSE repeat, etc etc</p>

                            
        <div class="text-questions">
          <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>
          <p>Arrays and objects are similar, whats different is how they are structered. Arrays apply numbers to strings (item listed) so to access anything in an array you would need</p>
          <p>to call the number related to that particular string.</p>
          <p>Objects are similar in that thay store information and you call that information out from them, but the information is stored differently</p>
          <p>Objects store there info in lists and they are referred to as keys and values, the key is similar to a heading and the value id usually related</p>
          <p>to that heading for eg: headig would be name value would be Bob, to call the information you waould call the key and it would output the</p>
          <p>value for that key.</p>
                                    
        <div class="text-questions">
          <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h4>
          <p>Functions group together a set of statements that calculates a value, to run a function you need to call it, the function will</p>
          <p>then perform the specified actions to provide an output.</p>
